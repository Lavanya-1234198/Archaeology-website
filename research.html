            <h2>New Discoveries Shed Light on Ancient Indian Civilization</h2>
            <p>Archaeologists have made a number of exciting new discoveries in recent years that have shed new light on the ancient history of India. These discoveries include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A new type of rock art in the Deccan Plateau.</li>
                <li>The oldest known human skeletons in India.</li>
            </ul>
<h2>A new type of rock art in the Deccan Plateau</h2>
<p>
 		In recent years, archaeologists have made a series of exciting discoveries of a new type of rock art in the Deccan Plateau of India. This rock art, which is found on laterite rock formations, consists of abstract symbols, geometric patterns, and depictions of animals and human figures. The researchers believe that the rock art may have been created by hunter-gatherers and pastoralists who lived in the region between 10,000 and 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>
		According to the 2022 researches .A team of archaeologists from the University of Hyderabad conducted a detailed study of the rock art. They found that the rock art is much more widespread than previously thought, with over 500 sites identified across the Deccan Plateau. They also found that the rock art is older than previously thought, dating back to at least 10,000 years ago.

		This image shows a variety of human figures found on rock panels in the Deccan Plateau. The figures are depicted in a variety of poses, including standing, sitting, and dancing. The researchers believe that these figures may have been used to record important events or to represent the people who created them.

<h2>The Oldest Known Human Skeletons in India</h2>
<p>
		In 2017, archaeologists discovered the remains of seven skeletons in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The skeletons, which are dated to around 75,000 years ago, are the oldest known human remains in India. The discovery was made by a team of archaeologists from the Anthropological Survey of India (ASI) at the site of Bhimbetka Rock Shelters, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>
		The skeletons were dated using a technique called uranium-series dating. This technique measures the amount of uranium and uranium decay products in the bones. The more uranium decay products there are, the older the bones are. In the case of the Bhimbetka skeletons, the uranium-series dating results indicate that the bones are around 75,000 years old.</p>

		<h2>Mysteries of Indian Archeaology</h2>
<p>Indian archaeology has a rich and fascinating history, with many mysteries still waiting to be solved.</p>
<h3>1. The Enigma of the Indus Valley Civilization:</h3>
<p>The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, flourished in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent between 3300 BCE and 1300 BCE. Despite extensive excavations and research, many aspects of this enigmatic civilization remain shrouded in mystery. The origins of the Indus people, their language, and the reasons for their eventual decline are still subjects of debate among archaeologists.</p>
<h2>2. The Lost City of Dvaravati:</h2>
<p>In ancient Indian literature, Dvaravati is mentioned as a prosperous city located in the central part of the country. However, the exact location of this city remains elusive, with no definitive archaeological evidence to confirm its existence. Some scholars believe that Dvaravati may have been a mythical city, while others suggest that it may be hidden under layers of sediment or obscured by dense vegetation.</p>
<h2>3.Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple:</h2>
<p>Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple, located in Thiruvananthapuram, India, is one of the 108 Divya Desams, or sacred temples dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The temple is also one of the richest temples in the world, with an estimated wealth of over $20 billion.In 2011, a Supreme Court-appointed panel ordered the opening of six vaults in the temple that had been sealed for over a century. The vaults were found to contain a vast treasure of gold, jewels, and other precious artifacts.The discovery of the treasure has sparked a number of mysteries and unanswered questions. The Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure is one of the most fascinating and mysterious discoveries in recent history. It is a reminder of the rich and complex history of India, and it continues to intrigue and inspire people from all over the world.</p>
