<h3>European archaeologists in india</h3>
<p>European archaeologists have had a significant influence on Indian archaeology in a number of ways. First, they introduced new and innovative archaeological methods to India. Second, they helped to train Indian archaeologists and to develop Indian archaeological institutions. Third, they helped to promote Indian archaeology to the world.

One of the most important contributions of European archaeologists to Indian archaeology was the introduction of new and innovative archaeological methods. For example, Sir Alexander Cunningham was one of the first archaeologists to use systematic survey and excavation methods in India. He also introduced the use of photography to document archaeological sites.</p>
<p>European archaeologists also helped to train Indian archaeologists and to develop Indian archaeological institutions. For example, Sir John Marshall established the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1902. The ASI is a government agency that is responsible for the protection and preservation of archaeological sites and artifacts in India.

European archaeologists also helped to promote Indian archaeology to the world. They published articles and books about their discoveries in India, and they gave lectures and presentations about Indian archaeology to European audiences. This helped to raise awareness of Indian archaeology in Europe and to promote interest in the field.</p>
<p>There have been many European archaeologists who have made significant contributions to the field of Indian archaeology. Here are a few examples:</p>
<h4>Sir Alexander Cunningham (1814-1893) </h4><p>Sir Alexander Cunningham (1814-1893) was a British military officer and archaeologist who is considered to be the father of Indian archaeology. He conducted extensive surveys and excavations across India, and is credited with discovering many important archaeological sites, including Sanchi, Bharhut, and Bodh Gaya. <br/><img src=" https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Alexander_Cunningham_of_the_ASI_02.jpg/800px-Alexander_Cunningham_of_the_ASI_02.jpg"/></p>
