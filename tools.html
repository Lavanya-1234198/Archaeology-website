<p>Archaeologists use a variety of tools to excavate and study archaeological sites in India. Some of the most common tools include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trowels: Trowels are used to dig and remove soil from archaeological sites.</li>
<li>Brushes: Brushes are used to clean and uncover artifacts.</li>
<li>Sieves: Sieves are used to sift through soil to find small artifacts.</li>
<li>Levels: Levels are used to measure the depth of artifacts and features.</li>
<li>Cameras: Cameras are used to photograph artifacts and features.</li>
</ul>

			<p>Sieves are used to sift through soil to find small artifacts. Sieves come in a variety of sizes and with different mesh sizes. 			The size of the mesh determines the size of the artifacts that can be found. Sieves are used to sift soil from both excavation 			units and from spoil heaps.</p>

		<p>Levels are used to measure the depth of artifacts and features. Levels are used to ensure that artifacts are excavated in a 			consistent and accurate manner. They are also used to measure the depth of features, such as trenches and pits.</p>

		<p> A magnifying glass is used to examine artifacts in detail. It is often used to identify small features and markings. The lens is used to magnify small objects such as insects or individual leaves on plants so that the viewer can better see them and the details on them. The amount of magnification depends on the power of the lens used, as well as the distance between the lens and the object</p>
